# MusicalStructure

PROJECT SPECIFICATION
Musical Structure

App Design

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Suitability

The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.

Clarity

Each activity is clearly labelled, using a TextView, such that the final purpose of such an activity is easy to understand. For instance, one screen might be labelled ‘song detail screen’ and another might be labelled ‘music library’

Plan for creation

Any activity that requires an external library or class not yet covered includes the name of that library or class. For instance, a payment screen might include information on how to process the payment.

Number of activities

The app contains 3 to 6 activities.

Layout

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Structure

The app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.

Labelling

Each activity contains a TextView which explains the purpose of the activity.

Buttons

Each activity contains buttons which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘now playing’ activity.

Layout Best Practices

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:

Text sizes are defined in sp
Lengths are defined in dp
Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
Functionality

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Runtime Errors

The code runs without errors

OnClickListeners

Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.

Intents

Each button properly opens the intended activity using an explicit Intent.

Code Quality

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
Code Formatting

The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.

Readability

Code is easily readable such that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.

Naming Conventions

All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
